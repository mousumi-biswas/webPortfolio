        <h3>Become a Professional Web Developer</h3>
        <p>
          I have always sought out opportunities and challenges that are
          meaningful to me. Although my professional path has taken many twists
          and turns. I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and
          solve problems. As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive
          attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things and my
          mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why
          I’m excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.
